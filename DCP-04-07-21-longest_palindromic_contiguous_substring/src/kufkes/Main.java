// Description (HARD):
//      This problem was asked by Amazon.
//          Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.
//          For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".
