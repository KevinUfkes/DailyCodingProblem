// Project: Daily Coding Problem from September 5, 2021
// Description (MEDIUM):
//      This problem was asked by Cisco.
//          Given an unsigned 8-bit integer, swap its even and odd bits. The 1st and 2nd bit should be swapped, the 3rd and 4th bit should be swapped, and so on.
//          For example, 10101010 should be 01010101. 11100010 should be 11010001.
//          Bonus: Can you do this in one line?
