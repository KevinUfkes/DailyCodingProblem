// Description (EASY):
//      Implement a stack that has the following methods:
//
//          push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
//          pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
//          max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
//          Each method should run in constant time
