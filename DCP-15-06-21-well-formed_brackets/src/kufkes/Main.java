// Description (EASY):
//      This problem was asked by Facebook.
//          Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).
//          For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.
//          Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.
