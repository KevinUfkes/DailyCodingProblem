// Description (HARD):
//      This problem was asked by Google.
//          Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.
//          For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:
//              10 = max(10, 5, 2)
//              7 = max(5, 2, 7)
//              8 = max(2, 7, 8)
//              8 = max(7, 8, 7)
//          Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.
